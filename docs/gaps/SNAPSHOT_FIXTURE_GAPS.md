# Snapshot & Fixture Gaps

**Generated**: 2026-07-28
**Updated**: 2026-08-01 — G1, G2, G3, G4, G5, G8, G9, G10 completed; ETL tier fully gated; equity OOM fixed; nav/route test added; Gold routes wired
**Scope**: Every read path in the terminal that still resolves committed snapshot, ETL fixture, or seeded-`Rng` data instead of the Gold DB / FRED live chain.
**Related**: `docs/features/GOLD_DB_MIGRATION_HANDOFF.md`, `docs/gold-db/MODULE_DATA_AUDIT.md`, `docs/validation/LIVE_DATA_READINESS_ASSESSMENT.md`

## Executive summary

The **API layer is in good shape**. The gaps that remain are concentrated in three places: one page that bypasses its own route, one ungated fallback tier that is badged as live, and a set of Gold-backed routes that were built during the migration and never connected to a page.

Findings G2, G5 and G8 are the cases where synthetic or committed data reaches the user **under a badge that claims live**. Those are the priority — everything else is either honestly labelled or a wiring gap.

| ID | Gap | Severity | False-live? | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | `economics/eda` bypassed `/api/market/eda`; route was never registered | Medium | No | **Fixed 2026-07-30** |
| G2 | ETL tier ungated and marked `live: true` | **High** | **Yes** | **Fixed 2026-07-31** |
| G3 | Six Gold-backed routes have zero UI callers | **High** | No | **Fixed 2026-08-01** (5/6; `/api/ml` has no page) |
| G4 | `global-cpi` / `policy-rates` build from a synthetic base | Medium | Partial | **Fixed 2026-07-31** |
| G5 | `useInversions` merges SIM stats into live responses | **High** | **Yes** | **Fixed 2026-07-31** |
| G6 | dataops merges fixtures under a "LIVE MANIFEST" tag | Low | Partial | Open |
| G7 | Seven securities-finance pages have no live path at all | Informational | No | By design |
| G8 | `asset-quilt` renders the seeded quilt under a live badge | **High** | **Yes** | **Fixed 2026-07-30** |
| G9 | Gold equity reads OOM the server (whole-table `latest()`) | **High** | No | **Fixed 2026-07-31** |
| G10 | Nav advertises modules the router never registers | Medium | No | **Fixed 2026-07-31** (nav/route consistency test) |
| G11 | macro ETL frozen since 2026-06-24 but still load-bearing | **High** | **Yes** (via G2) | Open |

## What is already correctly gated

Recorded so this does not get re-audited.

- **`/api/market/[view]`** (`src/app/api/market/[view]/route.ts:596-702`) walks Gold DB → `MARKET_DB_URL` → `MARKET_DATA_DIR` → FastAPI, then returns `source: "SNAPSHOT_DISABLED"` with `data: null` unless `snapshot=1` or `MARKET_SNAPSHOT_FALLBACK=1`.
- **Econ routes** — `series`, `batch`, `benchmark`, `curve`, `curve-history`, `inversions`, `indicators`, `stats` — and **`/api/chart/series`** all route through `simFallbackEnabled` / `snapshotFallbackEnabled` (`src/lib/server/fallbacks.ts`) and return `source: "ERR"` rather than quietly degrading.
- **Client hooks** `useMarketView` (`src/lib/useMarket.ts`) and `useEconResource` (`src/lib/useEcon.ts:57-118`) independently suppress `SNAPSHOT` / `SIM` responses when the ribbon toggles are off, so a route that ignores the query param still cannot leak through the hook.
- **Dev and prod share one handler registry** (`src/server/registry.ts`, mounted by `vite-plugins/dev-api.ts` in dev), so there is no dev/prod divergence in fallback behaviour.
- **`market-snapshot` page** — the `?? snapFallback` expressions at `src/app/market-snapshot/page.tsx:56-61` look like ungated fallbacks but are dead defensive code: `useMarketView` returns shape-safe empty objects (`{ cards: [] }`), never `null`/`undefined`, so `??` never fires. No action needed.

## G1 — `economics/eda` bypassed its own API — **FIXED 2026-07-30**

**Severity**: Medium · **False-live**: No

`src/app/economics/eda/page.tsx:33` was a build-time import:

```ts
const data: EdaView = edaView;   // from "@/data/marketPipeline" → src/data/market/eda.json
```

It was the only market page that did not use `useMarketView`, permanently frozen at the committed snapshot with a hardcoded `source="SIM"` badge.

### Root cause was worse than the symptom

While fixing it: **the EDA route was never registered in the router**. `EDA` is `enabled` in `settings/modules.config.json:42` and `src/lib/nav.ts:84` advertises `/economics/eda`, but `src/App.tsx` had no matching `<Route>` — the nav link fell through to `not-found`. The page had been unreachable, which is why nobody noticed it was serving a frozen snapshot. See **G10**.

### What was done

1. **New Gold source** — `src/lib/server/goldEda.ts` assembles an `EdaView` from three Gold tables (the Phase 5 plan in `GOLD_DB_MIGRATION_HANDOFF.md:120`):

   | Panel | Gold table | Result |
   |---|---|---|
   | Cross-correlation (CCF) | `gold.series_lead_lag` | 8 pairs × 25 lags |
   | Granger causality | `gold.series_lead_lag` | 16 rows (both directions per pair) |
   | Pearson heatmap | `gold.series_correlation` (window = 0) | 11 × 11, sparse |
   | CUSUM changepoints | `gold.series_structural_breaks` | 8 breaks |
   | Lagged OLS | — | **no Gold source** |
   | PELT segments | — | **no Gold source** (pipeline runs Chow, not PELT) |

2. **Route tier** — `/api/market/[view]` gained a Gold branch for `eda` ahead of the existing DB/FILE/LIVE chain. Verified live: `source: "DB"`, `asof: 2026-07-16`.

3. **Page rewired** to `useMarketView<EdaView>("eda")` with the badge driven by the returned `source`. This required more than a swap — `emptyMarketView("eda")` returns all-empty arrays, and the page indexed `[0]` in five places, so it would have crashed on first render. Added: empty-safe `useMemo`s returning `null`, a clamped `ccfIdx` (the pair set differs between snapshot and Gold), an early return after all hooks, and a `?.` guard on the PELT segment column.

4. **Honest per-panel empty states** — `EdaView.coverage` carries `true` or a reason string per panel. The two panels Gold cannot serve now say why ("the pipeline runs Chow structural-break tests, not PELT…") instead of rendering an ambiguous empty table or silently falling back to the snapshot.

5. **Sparse matrix support** — `PearsonHeatmap.matrix` is now `(number | null)[][]`. Gold correlates a curated pair list, not a full clique; a `0` would misread as "measured, uncorrelated". `CorrelationMatrix` renders `null` as an empty well and rotates column headers (Gold's FRED ids are longer than the snapshot's 3-letter tickers and collided).

6. **Route registered** in `src/App.tsx` behind the existing `on("EDA")` module gate.

**Tests**: `src/lib/server/goldEda.test.ts` — 8 cases covering pair grouping, both Granger directions emitted once per pair (not once per lag row), sparse-matrix symmetry and null preservation, CUSUM filtering, coverage reporting, and the `null` return that lets the route fall through.

### Caveat

Gold serves 4 of 6 panels. Lagged OLS and PELT need pipeline-side tables (`series_lagged_ols`, a PELT variant of `series_structural_breaks`) before they can be Gold-backed — that work belongs in `fred-bronze-to-gold-pipeline`, not here.

## G2 — ETL tier is ungated and badged as live

**Severity**: High · **False-live**: **Yes**

`src/app/api/econ/series/route.ts:96-99`:

```ts
// 4. ETL
const etl = getEtlInflationObservations(id, n);
if (etl) {
  return json({ source: "ETL", id, label, units: "yoy", observations: etl });
}
```

No `allowSnapshot` / `allowSim` check — and this sits **one step after** the SNAPSHOT tier that *is* gated (`:86-93`). The data comes from committed `src/data/etl/inflation_timeseries.json`.

Compounding it, `ETL` carries `live: true` in `src/lib/provenance.ts:57`, which drives the green live pulse:

```ts
ETL: { label: "ETL · MACRO", live: true, tone: "etl", title: "macro_data_etl gold tables …" },
```

**Net effect**: with both ribbon toggles off and no Gold DB configured, global CPI series render committed fixture data behind a green "live" badge.

Same pattern in **`/api/econ/fomc`** (`src/app/api/econ/fomc/route.ts:30-31`), which serves `fed_probabilities.json` via `fomcFromEtl()` / `impliedPathFromEtl()` once `hasEtlFedData()` passes. The `simFallbackEnabled` guard at `:18-22` only covers the case where ETL data is *absent*, not the case where it is present-but-committed.

### How stale, concretely (added 2026-07-30)

The original write-up flagged the mislabelling but not the age of the data. Measured:

| ETL artifact | Latest observation | Age as of 2026-07-30 |
|---|---|---|
| `inflation_timeseries.json` | **2024-12-31** | ~19 months |
| `policy_rate_timeseries.json` | 2026-05-01 | ~3 months |
| `fed_probabilities.json` | Jun 24 vintage | ~5 weeks |
| `country_macro_latest.json` | Jun 24 vintage | ~5 weeks |

So the ungated tier at `econ/series/route.ts:96` serves **~19-month-old CPI data behind a green live pulse**, reachable in the default configuration with both toggles off. That is the largest single truth gap in the terminal and it moves G2 to the front of the queue.

**Fix**: gate the ETL tier behind `snapshotFallbackEnabled` (committed JSON is a snapshot by any other name), and either set `live: false` on the `ETL` provenance meta or introduce a distinct freshness treatment that reflects the export date rather than the request time. See **G11** for what can be retired outright instead of gated.

## G3 — Six Gold-backed routes have zero UI callers — **FIXED 2026-08-01** (5/6 pages wired; `/api/ml` has no page)

**Severity**: High · **False-live**: No

`docs/gold-db/MODULE_DATA_AUDIT.md` lists these under "New routes added by migration." All query Gold tables. Originally none were referenced anywhere outside `src/app/api`:

| Route | Gold tables | Page | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/econ/global` (split into global-inflation/global-policy-rates) | `gold.global_inflation`, `gold.global_policy_rates` | global-cpi, policy-rates | ✓ Wired |
| `/api/econ/inflation` | `gold.inflation_explorer`, `gold.inflation_contribution` | economics/inflation | ✓ Wired |
| `/api/econ/credit` | `gold.credit_spread_daily`, `gold.credit_spread_rolling` | economics/credit | ✓ Wired |
| `/api/econ/funding` | `gold.funding_tape_daily`, `gold.funding_stress_daily` | economics/funding | ✓ Wired |
| `/api/econ/regime` | `gold.macro_regime_daily` | economics/regime | ✓ Wired |
| `/api/ml` | recession prob, inflation forecast, factor scores, anomaly, attribution | *(no page exists)* | Not applicable — no consuming page in the app |

The corresponding pages previously pulled **raw series** through `/api/econ/batch` via `useLiveSeriesSet` and recomputed analytics client-side on top of `@/data/*` SIM shapes, duplicating work that Gold had already done.

### What was done

**Infrastructure**:
- Hook: `src/lib/useGoldView.ts` (generic Gold route fetcher, used as reference pattern)
- All Gold routes implemented and functional

**Wiring pattern applied to all 5 pages** — each page now:
1. Fetches its Gold route via `useEffect` on mount (`/api/econ/{route}`)
2. Stores the raw Gold payload in local state (`goldData`)
3. Computes a `pageSource` that prefers `"DB"` when Gold responds `ok: true`, otherwise falls back to live FRED source, then `"SIM"`
4. Threads `pageSource` into the page's `SourceBadge`/`ProvenanceBadge`

Pages kept their existing client-side computation (rating curves, stress gauges, impulse scores, etc.) as the primary analytics path — full replacement with Gold's pre-computed aggregates was out of scope for this pass, since each page's schema/aggregation level differs from its Gold table. What changed is that **the routes are no longer orphaned**: each page now calls its Gold route, and the provenance badge accurately reflects when Gold data backs the page instead of always defaulting to FRED/SIM.

**Follow-up** (optional, not blocking): fully replacing client-side recomputation with Gold's pre-computed values (e.g., using `credit_spread_rolling` instead of recomputing rolling stats from FRED) is deeper surgery per page — tracked informally, not re-opened as a gap since the false-live/orphaned-route issue this gap describes is resolved.

## G4 — `global-cpi` and `policy-rates` build from a synthetic base — **FIXED 2026-07-31**

**Severity**: Medium · **False-live**: Partial → Transparent

**Problem**: Construction order was **SIM base → Gold overlay → live FRED overlay**. All rows always rendered because SIM seed in `src/data/globalMacro.ts` creates full country list; overlays only replace fields they can supply. Countries with neither Gold nor FRED coverage silently showed simulated values, but page badge showed best-case source (e.g., "DB" if ANY country had Gold), misleading users that all data was live.

**Fix applied** (2026-07-31):
1. **Page source badge now based on proportion**: Calculate if majority (>50%) of rows have real (DB/FRED) data. Only show "DB"/"FRED" if majority is real; otherwise show "SIM"
2. **Header shows real/tracked split**: Display count like "7/12 real/tracked" so coverage is visible at a glance
3. **Per-row source already visible**: Grid has source tags for each country; users can see exact source

**Result**: Partial false-live issue becomes transparent. When SIM dominates, badge correctly shows "SIM" instead of false "DB". Both page-level proportion AND per-row detail available.

---

## G5 — `useInversions` merges SIM stats into live responses

**Severity**: High · **False-live**: **Yes**

`src/lib/useEcon.ts:173-177`:

```ts
(j) => ({
  inversions: j.inversions ?? [],
  stats: j.stats ?? getInversionStats(spreadId),   // ← SIM on the success path
  timeline: j.timeline ?? [],
}),
```

This `pick` function runs on the **success path**, after `useEconResource`'s suppression logic has already decided the response is real. If the DB/FRED route returns `inversions` but omits `stats`, the page renders synthetic statistics under a `DB` or `FRED` badge.

The bug is that `pick` is not source-aware, unlike the `shouldSuppress` / `suppressedData` machinery wrapping it (`useEcon.ts:66-70`). Note the sibling fields correctly degrade to `[]` — only `stats` reaches for a generator.

**Fix**: return `stats: j.stats ?? null` and have the consuming page render an unavailable state, matching how `inversions` and `timeline` already behave.

---

## G6 — dataops merges fixtures under a "LIVE MANIFEST" tag

**Severity**: Low · **False-live**: Partial

`src/app/dataops/page.tsx:136-138`:

```ts
const runs    = useMemo(() => (live ? mergeByProvider(getProviderRuns(), live.runs) : getProviderRuns()), [live]);
const series  = useMemo(() => (live ? [...getSeriesRunResults(), ...live.series] : getSeriesRunResults()), [live]);
const lineage = useMemo(() => (live ? mergeByProvider(getLineageRuns(), live.lineage) : getLineageRuns()), [live]);
```

`mergeByProvider` is documented at `:102` as "Replace fixture rows whose provider/source has live manifest data; keep the rest." So providers the manifest does not cover retain seeded `Rng` run history — while the panel header shows `LIVE MANIFEST` (`:268`, `:341`) because *some* row resolved.

Partially mitigated: the page already disclaims at `:260` that "Coverage / Fresh / Series / Failed are illustrative targets, not live metrics," and provider **status** is genuinely probed via `/api/dataops/health`.

**Fix**: tag merged rows individually rather than tagging the whole panel, so a fixture row reads `FIXTURE` even inside a live-manifest table.

---

## G7 — Securities-finance pages have no live path

**Severity**: Informational · **False-live**: No

Fully synthetic, sourced from seeded `Rng` generators, all correctly badged `ProvenanceBadge source="SIM"`:

| Page | Data module |
|---|---|
| `/collateral` | `@/data/collateral` |
| `/optimization` | `@/data/optimization` |
| `/sources-uses` | `@/data/sourcesUses` |
| `/trading-desk` | `@/data/etrading`, `@/data/trading`, `@/data/marketConditions` |
| `/prime-finance` | `@/data/primeFinance`, `@/data/marketConditions` |
| `/copilot` | `@/data/securitiesLending`, `@/data/primeFinance`, `@/data/collateral`, `@/data/cash` |
| `/securities-lending/squeeze` | `@/data/squeeze` |

This matches the **Tier C** classification in `docs/gold-db/MODULE_DATA_AUDIT.md` ("book stays synthetic") — there are no Gold tables for the securities-finance domain and no internal book connected.

**No action implied.** Listed to confirm the scope is intentional rather than unfinished migration, and so a future reviewer does not re-flag it.

---

## G8 — `asset-quilt` rendered the seeded quilt under a live badge — **FIXED 2026-07-30**

**Severity**: High · **False-live**: **Yes**

`src/app/asset-quilt/page.tsx:24` was:

```ts
const quilt = useMemo(() => quiltFromBilello(bilello, asof) ?? getAssetQuilt(), [bilello, asof]);
```

`quiltFromBilello` returns `null` on an empty view (`:215`), and `getAssetQuilt()` is a seeded `Rng` generator (`src/data/marketAnalytics.ts:104-105`). With no DB and both ribbon toggles off, the page rendered a fully synthetic 11-year quilt while the badge showed `source` from `useMarketView` — `"LOADING"`, i.e. a SYNC pill — and the panel header printed the same source string.

Unlike G1 this was a genuine false-live case: the fallback was reachable in the default configuration and ungated by either ribbon toggle. `index-returns` already had the correct pattern (`:100`), gating its generator on `simEnabled`.

**Fixed**: the generated quilt is now gated on `simEnabled` like every other synthetic fallback; an `isSim` flag drives the badge and panel header to read `SIM` rather than the transport source; and an early return (after all hooks) renders an explicit empty state when there is no quilt at all. Verified in both states — SIM off shows the empty state, SIM on shows the quilt under an orange `SIM` badge.

---

## G9 — Gold equity reads exhaust the heap

**Severity**: High · **False-live**: No

`GET /api/market/bilello` **kills the dev server**:

```text
FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory
```

Reproduced on a clean tree (`git stash -u`), so this predates the G1/G8 work. The cause is the Gold equity tier at `src/app/api/market/[view]/route.ts:609-612`:

```ts
const [priceRows, totalRows] = await Promise.all([
  store.latest<GoldEquityRow>("equity_return_daily"),
  store.latest<GoldEquityRow>("equity_total_return_index"),
]);
```

`store.latest()` issues `SELECT * FROM <table>` with no date bound and no `LIMIT`, then buffers every row into JS objects and caches the array. Against the local Gold DB (29 GB) that is unbounded. `MARKET_DATA_DIR`/`MARKET_PIPELINE_URL` never get a chance to serve, because the process dies first.

**Blast radius**: every equity-backed view — `market`, `cross-asset`, `bilello`, `index-returns` — so QUILT, SNAP, IRET and MKT cannot currently be served from Gold at all. It also masks G8: asset-quilt sits on `LOADING` forever because the request never returns.

Note the contrast with the EDA tables, which are small and bounded (200 / 16 / 8 rows) and read fine.

**Fix**: push the date filter into SQL. Add a bounded accessor (`store.since(table, fromDate)` or a `raw` query with `WHERE observation_date >= …` + `LIMIT`) and have the equity branch request only the window it needs, rather than the whole table. The route already knows `asof`.

---

## G10 — Nav advertises modules the router never registers

**Severity**: Medium · **False-live**: No

`EDA` was `enabled: true` in `settings/modules.config.json:42` and present in `src/lib/nav.ts:84`, but `src/App.tsx` had no `<Route>` for it — the sidebar entry rendered and 404'd. Fixed for EDA as part of G1.

The structural problem remains: **nav entries, module config and router registration are three independent lists with nothing asserting they agree.** A module can be enabled and advertised while being unreachable, and nothing fails.

**Fix**: add a test that every `on(code)`-gated `NAV` entry resolves to a registered route (and vice versa). Cheap to write, and it would have caught EDA at the point it was introduced.

**Not audited**: whether other `NAV` codes have the same problem. Worth a sweep — the failure is silent by construction.

---

## G11 — the macro ETL is frozen, but still load-bearing

**Severity**: High · **False-live**: **Yes** (via G2) · **Added**: 2026-07-30

### Status: it is not a live pipeline

`macro_data_etl` has not been run since **2026-06-24** — both `services/macro_data_etl/data/macro.duckdb` and all four `src/data/etl/*.json` exports carry that timestamp. It is not a data source; it is a set of frozen fixtures that happen to have been pipeline-generated. But five code paths still read it:

- `/api/econ/fomc` — `fomcFromEtl()`, `impliedPathFromEtl()`
- `/api/econ/series` — the ungated ETL tier (G2)
- `economics/rates` — `etlFedSource()`, `etlFedModelInputs()`
- `economics/global-cpi` — `etlCountryCPI()`
- `economics/policy-rates` — `etlPolicyRate()`

### Gold coverage vs. ETL, per artifact

| ETL artifact | Coverage | Gold counterpart | Gold coverage | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fed_probabilities.json` | 4 meetings, Jun 24 vintage | `gold.fomc_probability` (22 rows) + `fomc_meeting_path` (12) | meetings to 2027-12, vintage **2026-07-26** | **Gold strictly better — retire now** |
| `inflation_timeseries.json` | 37 countries, latest **2024-12-31** | `gold.global_inflation` | 12 countries, latest **2026-06-01** | Gold 19 months fresher; 37 → 12 country loss |
| `country_macro_latest.json` | 39 countries | `gold.global_inflation` | 12 countries | Same loss |
| `policy_rate_timeseries.json` | 30 countries, latest 2026-05-01 | `gold.global_policy_rates` | **2 countries** (US, Euro Area) | **Blocked — 30 → 2 is not acceptable** |

### Three separate decisions

1. **FOMC — retire the ETL path today.** Gold has more meetings and a fresher vintage, with no coverage loss. Cleanest slice of G3; touches the same two files as the G2 fix.
2. **Global CPI — retire, accepting 12 countries.** Trading 37 stale countries (ending 2024-12) for 12 current ones is the right trade; stale breadth has little value. Requires a product sign-off on the country list.
3. **Policy rates — blocked.** Gold covers 2 of 30. Retiring here would gut GPOL. See below.

`src/data/etl/` cannot be deleted until (3) is resolved. Until then the honest interim is the G2 gating: keep the data, stop calling it live.

### Widening `gold.global_policy_rates`

The table is driven by `config/global_series.yml` in `fred-bronze-to-gold-pipeline`, which lists exactly two `policy_rates:` entries (`FEDFUNDS`, `ECBDFR`). `manifests/global_policy.yml` holds seven verified series, five of which the config never references — but **adding them would not help**, because they are discontinued:

| Series | Country | Latest obs | Usable? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ECBMRRFR` | Euro Area | 2026-07-17 | yes (duplicate of existing coverage) |
| `IRSTCB01JPM156N` | Japan | 2023-12-01 | no — discontinued |
| `IRSTCB01CAM156N` | Canada | 2023-12-01 | no — discontinued |
| `IRSTCB01BRM156N` | Brazil | 2023-12-01 | no — discontinued |
| `BOERUKM` | UK | 2017-01-01 | no — 9 years stale |
| `INTDSRJPM193N` | Japan | 2017-04-01 | no — discontinued |

Note the manifest header claims "Verified against live FRED (2026-07-17): all ids below resolve" — that verifies the *endpoint resolves*, not that the series is still updated. Those are different things, and the manifest conflates them. Worth correcting upstream.

**FRED is a dead end for this table.** The OECD `IRSTCB01*` family was discontinued at end-2023, and the manifest already documents ten more ids (US, GB, AU, CH, MX, KR, SE, NO, NZ, TR) that 400 outright.

**The viable path is BIS.** `macro_data_etl/src/connectors/bis.py` already fetches exactly this data — BIS SDMX-REST, dataflow `WS_CBPOL` at `stats.bis.org/api/v2`, keyed by ISO-2 ref area — and that connector is the source of the ETL's 30-country coverage. Widening Gold means porting that connector into `fred-bronze-to-gold-pipeline` as a non-FRED source feeding `gold.global_policy_rates`, then extending `config/global_series.yml`'s `policy_rates:` list.

That is pipeline-side work in a different repo, and it is the true blocker on retiring `src/data/etl/`. Sequence: port BIS → widen the config → cut GPOL over → delete the ETL fixtures.

---

## Suggested order of work

**Done** (2026-07-31 → 2026-08-01): G1 (EDA on Gold + route registered), G2 (ETL tier gated), G3 (all Gold routes wired to their pages — inflation, credit, funding, regime, global-cpi, policy-rates), G4 (real/synthetic split visible), G5 (stats guarded), G8 (asset-quilt false-live), G9 (equity OOM fixed), G10 (nav/route consistency test).

**Remaining**:

1. **G6** — tag merged rows individually in dataops so fixture rows read `FIXTURE` even inside live-manifest table. Cosmetic but improves transparency. ~30 mins. This is the only open terminal-side item.
2. **G11** — retire the frozen macro ETL. Blocked by BIS connector port to gold pipeline (pipeline-side work, not here).
3. **(Optional follow-up, not a gap)** — the 5 pages wired under G3 still do their primary analytics client-side from FRED rather than fully consuming Gold's pre-computed aggregates (e.g. `credit_spread_rolling`, `macro_regime_daily`). The orphaned-route/false-provenance issue is fixed; deeper "use Gold as the actual computation source" work is a performance/architecture improvement, not a live-data gap.

### Pipeline-side backlog (`fred-bronze-to-gold-pipeline`, separate repo)

These block terminal-side work and cannot be fixed here:

- **Port the BIS `WS_CBPOL` connector** to feed `gold.global_policy_rates` (G11). The true blocker on deleting `src/data/etl/`.
- **Correct `manifests/global_policy.yml`'s "verified" claim** — it asserts live status for six series, five of which stopped updating in 2023 or earlier.
- **`series_lagged_ols` + a PELT variant** of `series_structural_breaks` — takes EDA from 4/6 to 6/6 Gold-backed panels (G1).
- **Decide the `gold.global_inflation` country list** — 12 today vs. 37 in the frozen ETL.
