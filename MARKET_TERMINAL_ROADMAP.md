# Market Terminal Review & Roadmap

Date: 2026-06-18

## ▶ Current top priority (2026-10-17)

The roadmap below dates from 2026-06-18. **The highest-priority build is now InventoryBallast
spec `0018-live-poc-showcase`**: a live proof of concept across IBAL, a new money market execution
optimizer, a configurable sources and uses LP/MIP optimizer, and a liquidity forecasting, shortfall
and anomaly oversight cockpit, each on its own Python service with a white paper. It delivers
several modules this roadmap proposed:

| This roadmap | Delivered by `0018` as |
| --- | --- |
| §6 `LIQ` — Liquidity & Funding Stress Cockpit | Workstream E (`spec014`, `services/liquidity_api`) |
| §8 `XOPT` — Real Local Optimization Runner | Workstreams C and D on `services/optimization_core`; OPT shows real run history |
| §5 `REINV` — Cash Collateral Reinvestment Desk | Partly: the optional engine reinvestment term fed by the MMKT yield (`0018` REQ-010) |
| "Phase 4: Real Optimization" | Workstreams B–D |

Where to start: `docs/handoff.md`, "▶ TOP PRIORITY". The source of truth is the InventoryBallast
spec, not this file.

## Executive Summary

The current `market_terminal` build is already pointed in the right institutional direction: a dense, keyboard-driven securities finance terminal with modules for markets, securities lending, prime finance, collateral, cash, sources and uses, optimization, trading, alerts, AI, and a full Economics & Macro section. The strongest design choice is the explicit linkage between macro conditions and securities finance economics. This is the right spine for collateral management, optimization, securities lending, and funding analytics because those businesses are driven by rates, credit, liquidity, balance sheet usage, and asset availability.

The main opportunity is to move from deterministic demo generators toward a local, adapter-driven data and analytics layer. FRED can anchor macro, rates, credit-spread, liquidity, and policy-rate data. Yahoo Finance/yfinance can provide prototype-grade prices, volumes, ETFs, options-adjacent signals, and asset proxies, while staying behind a replaceable `MarketDataAdapter`. The repo already contains the beginning of that architecture in `market_data_pipeline`, including FRED and Yahoo connectors, DuckDB/Parquet storage, lineage, data quality checks, and FastAPI endpoints.

Recommended direction: build a local "collateral and financing intelligence layer" that combines FRED macro factors, Yahoo market proxies, synthetic/internal books, and optimization outputs. Treat Yahoo as research/local-only, not a production dependency. Preserve clean upgrade paths to paid APIs such as Bloomberg, Refinitiv/LSEG, FactSet, S&P/Markit, DataLend, EquiLend, FIS/Loanet, Pirum, Broadridge, Hazeltree, IHS Markit/S&P securities finance, TriOptima, Acadia, ICE, CME, DTCC, BNY, or custody/prime internal feeds.

## Current Build Review

### What Is Already Strong

- `ECON`, `CURV`, `INFL`, `GCPI`, `GPOL`, `CRDT`, `FOMC`, `STAT`, `EML`, and `SFE` form a credible macro suite.
- `SFE` is the clearest domain bridge: repo complex, rate sensitivities, reinvestment ladder, and macro-to-business linkage.
- `COLL`, `CASH`, `SXU`, and `OPT` already model the core workflow: margin requirements, collateral eligibility, constraints, funding sources, allocation, shadow prices, and recommended trades.
- `SLAB` has the right basic securities lending shape: lendable inventory, loan book, borrow demand, utilization, specials, HTB names, revenue by borrower/security/asset class, and beneficial-owner-to-borrower flow.
- `market_data_pipeline` is a strong foundation for local scaling: adapter interfaces, FRED/Yahoo connectors, raw/silver/gold layers, DuckDB, Parquet, quality checks, and FastAPI service boundaries.
- The app already communicates data provenance with `LIVE · FRED`, `ETL · MACRO`, `SIM`, and deterministic fallbacks. Keep that pattern.

### Main Gaps

- Collateral and lending pages are still mostly deterministic domain data rather than computed from a canonical factor/book model.
- Macro signals do not yet flow directly into optimizer objective functions, haircuts, lendable-value forecasts, or funding-cost curves.
- Yahoo Finance is present in the Python pipeline but not yet fully feeding terminal pages through a shared local API.
- The repo has two data worlds: TypeScript deterministic generators in `src/data/*` and the Python medallion pipeline. These should converge through typed API responses or exported local JSON/Parquet snapshots.
- There is no dedicated collateral asset pricing/risk module, no eligibility rule engine, no securities-lending rate estimator, and no margin/liquidity stress cockpit.
- Optimization results are realistic in shape but not yet backed by a real local solver run.

## API Positioning

### FRED

Use FRED as the official free macro source. The existing FRED endpoint pattern is right: server-side only, cached, units-corrected, and provenance-aware. FRED can support:

- Treasury rates and curve factors.
- SOFR, EFFR, IORB, RRP, fed funds and policy backdrop.
- CPI, PCE, labor, growth, recession, financial conditions, money/reserves, and banking/liquidity series.
- ICE BofA credit spread series available through FRED.
- Release calendars and historical macro time series.

### Yahoo Finance / yfinance

Use Yahoo/yfinance for local research and prototyping only. It can provide useful public-market proxies, but it is not a licensed securities finance, collateral, corporate actions, or redistribution-grade feed. The current `YahooConnector` stance is correct: cache aggressively, rate-limit, store raw responses, and keep the adapter replaceable.

Yahoo/yfinance can support:

- Equity/ETF prices and returns for collateral assets and lendable inventory.
- Proxy baskets for sectors, regions, factors, vol, rates ETFs, credit ETFs, commodities, FX, and crypto.
- Volume, volatility, drawdown, beta, momentum, and liquidity proxy analytics.
- Options-chain-derived prototype signals where available, with clear caveats.

## Data Architecture Roadmap

### Phase 1: Local Data Contract

- Define a canonical TypeScript API contract for market series, macro series, collateral assets, agreements, positions, loans, margin calls, and optimization outputs.
- Add a local API bridge from `market_data_pipeline` to the Next app:
  - `GET /snapshot/market`
  - `GET /snapshot/rates`
  - `GET /series/{id}`
  - `GET /collateral/factors`
  - `GET /lending/rate-estimates`
  - `GET /optimization/runs/{id}`
- Keep deterministic fallbacks for all modules.

### Phase 2: Factor Store

- Create a local factor store table:
  - `factor_id`
  - `source`
  - `vendor_symbol`
  - `series_id`
  - `date`
  - `value`
  - `transform`
  - `frequency`
  - `quality_status`
  - `as_of`
- Build initial factors:
  - Rates: SOFR, EFFR, IORB, RRP, DGS1M-DGS30.
  - Curve: 2s10s, 3m10y, level/slope/curvature.
  - Credit: IG OAS, HY OAS, rating OAS.
  - Liquidity: reserves, RRP, stress indexes.
  - Market proxies: SPY, QQQ, IWM, HYG, LQD, TLT, SHY, BIL, GLD, UUP, sector ETFs.
  - Derived: realized vol, beta, drawdown, momentum, liquidity score.

### Phase 3: Domain Models

- Convert `src/data/collateral.ts` and `src/data/securitiesLending.ts` from pure generators to model layers that can consume:
  - local synthetic book data,
  - factor store values,
  - optimization outputs,
  - optional live pipeline API data.
- Keep seeded demo data as a fixture source.

### Phase 4: Real Optimization

- Implement OR-Tools collateral optimizer in Python.
- Expose solver runs through FastAPI.
- Store model inputs and outputs for auditability.

## Production Upgrade Principles

- Keep FRED as the preferred free macro source.
- Keep Yahoo/yfinance local-only, cached, throttled, and replaceable.
- Store raw provider payloads before transforms.
- Make every displayed value traceable to provider, symbol/series, date, transform, and run id.
- Avoid hard-coding vendor-specific semantics into UI components.
- Make synthetic fallback an explicit provider, not hidden mock data.
- Separate "book of record" data from public proxy factors.
- Treat recommendations as explainable analytics, not black-box model outputs.

## Practical Next Step

Build `CFI` first. It is the highest-leverage bridge between the existing macro stack and the optimization/collateral/securities-lending stack. It can start entirely locally with FRED, Yahoo/yfinance, and synthetic book data, but its scoring outputs immediately become useful inputs for `COLL`, `SLAB`, `CASH`, `SFE`, and `OPT`.
